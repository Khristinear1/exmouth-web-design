                    <p>Torquay is a seaside resort town on the English Channel in Devon, south west England. Known for beaches such as Babbacombe and cliffside Oddicombe, its coastline is nicknamed the English Riviera. Torquay Harbour near the town centre offers shops, cafes and a marina. Torre Abbey, a monastery founded in 1196, has art galleries and extensive gardens featuring plants from local writer Agatha Christie's novels.</p>

                    <p> A cheerful place, epitomised by the colourful lights which go right around the bay. They're on all year round and it lends a bit of cheer, especially when you see them in January. The town area is quite spread out and occupies a rock promontory which divides Babbacombe Bay from Tor Bay.</p>
